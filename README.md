# Deep-Neural-Network-from-scratch
Implementing a deep feedforward neural network from scratch in Python, using only numpy.


The neural network was initially designed to work on MNIST but can be adapted to any feedforward architecture and to any dataset.

The network is implemented in Object-Oriented fashion: we create a NeuralNetwrok class and define various methods in order to operate and train the network. This means the network can be adapted seamlessly to any architecture simply by changing the nn_architecture dictionary.
